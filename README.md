# Smart-Coffee-ESP8266
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to take my roommates old cheap coffee maker and make it into a smart coffee maker using an ESP8266 WiFi chip. That is, it can turn on with a voice command from a google home, Alexa, or even Cortana on Windows 10. Using this feature, I also made a routine on my own google home that triggers the coffee maker to start in the mornings automatically whenever my alarm goes off. This helps motivate me to get up and makes my morning routine just a little smoother.

1. ESP8266 Chip
